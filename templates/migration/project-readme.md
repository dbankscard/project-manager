## Status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | planning |
| **Priority** | {{priority}} |
| **Progress** | 0% |
| **Created** | {{date}} |
| **Slug** | {{slug}} |
| **Type** | Migration |

## Goals

- [ ] Complete audit of source environment
- [ ] Define migration scope and success criteria
- [ ] Execute pilot migration with validation
- [ ] Complete full rollout with zero data loss
- [ ] Decommission legacy system

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Project kickoff | {{date}} | done |
| Source audit complete | | pending |
| Pilot group migrated | | pending |
| Full rollout complete | | pending |
| Legacy system decommissioned | | pending |

## Migration Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Source** | _TBD_ |
| **Target** | _TBD_ |
| **Affected Users/Devices** | _TBD_ |
| **Pilot Group Size** | _TBD_ |
| **Rollback Window** | _TBD_ |

## Risks

- **Data loss during migration** — Mitigation: full backup before each phase, validation checksums
- **User disruption** — Mitigation: pilot group first, off-hours migration windows
- **Integration breakage** — Mitigation: test all integrations in pilot before rollout
- **Timeline slip** — Mitigation: phase-gated milestones with go/no-go checkpoints
