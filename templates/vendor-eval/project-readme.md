| **Type** | Vendor Evaluation |

## Goals

- [ ] Define evaluation criteria and requirements
- [ ] Identify and shortlist vendor candidates
- [ ] Complete demos and technical evaluations
- [ ] Run proof-of-concept with top candidate
- [ ] Complete security and compliance review
- [ ] Make final vendor selection and procurement

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Project kickoff | {{date}} | done |
| Requirements defined | | pending |
| RFP sent / demos scheduled | | pending |
| POC complete | | pending |
| Security review complete | | pending |
| Vendor selected | | pending |

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Feature fit | | _Must-haves vs nice-to-haves_ |
| Security & compliance | | _SOC 2, SSO, encryption_ |
| Integration capability | | _API, SSO, directory sync_ |
| Total cost of ownership | | _License + implementation + ongoing_ |
| Support quality | | _SLAs, escalation, documentation_ |
| Scalability | | _Growth capacity_ |

## Risks

- **Vendor lock-in** — Mitigation: evaluate data export capabilities and API openness
- **Hidden costs** — Mitigation: request full TCO breakdown including implementation
- **Feature gaps** — Mitigation: POC testing with real use cases before commitment
- **Timeline pressure** — Mitigation: set clear evaluation deadlines upfront
