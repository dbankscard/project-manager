## Audit Scope

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Compliance Frameworks** | _e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, CIS_ |
| **Systems in Scope** | _TBD_ |
| **Excluded Systems** | _TBD_ |
| **Assessment Period** | _TBD_ |
| **Assessor** | _Internal / External firm_ |

## Risks

- **Scope creep** — Mitigation: document scope boundaries clearly upfront
- **Critical findings requiring emergency action** — Mitigation: have incident response plan ready
- **Resource constraints for remediation** — Mitigation: prioritize by severity, phase remediation
- **Compliance deadline pressure** — Mitigation: start early, track against framework deadlines
